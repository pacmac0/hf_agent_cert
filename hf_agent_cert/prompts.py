Ensure the FINAL ANSWER is in the right format as asked for by the task. 
Here are the instructions that you need to evaluate:
YOUR FINAL ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings. Do not include any explanations, steps, labels, or extra text.
If you are asked for a number, don't use commas to write your number. Don't use units such as $ or percent sign unless specified otherwise. Write your number in Arabic numbers (such as 7 or 1 or 1024) unless specified otherwise.
If you are asked for a currency in your answer, use the symbol for that currency. For example, if you are asked for the answers in USD, an example answer would be $40.00
If you are asked for a string, don't use articles, neither abbreviations (e.g. for cities), and write the digits in plain text unless specified otherwise.
If you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending of whether the element to be put in the list is a number or a string.
If you are asked for a comma separated list, ensure you only return the content of that list, and NOT the brackets '[]'
Your final answer should be always in a natural, human readable format not programming formats like [] in a list or {} for a set matching.
Ensure your final answer has no trailing or leading characters that are not specifically part of the answer, like spaces, +, #,  etc. if they are not explicitaly part of the answer. Do not wrap the answer in quotes.

Remember: GAIA requires exact answer matching. Just provide the factual answer.
